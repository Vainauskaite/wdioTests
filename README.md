## Requirements


### Prerequisites

* npm >=7.3.0
* node >=15.5.1

### ðŸš€ Test it!

Make sure you have Node and NPM installed by running simple commands to see what version of each is installed:

* **Test Node.** To see if Node is installed, type ```node -v``` in Terminal. This should print the version number, so youâ€™ll see something like this v0.10.31.
* **Test NPM.** To see if NPM is installed, type ```npm -v``` in Terminal. This should print the version number, so youâ€™ll see something like this 1.4.27
* Run `npm install`

## Run tests
* npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js
